<p>Bruce was raised in a small community on the coast of the Great Lakes. He realized when he was young that if the family's ducck tour business was going to be able to support their large family, they would need to advertise online. So he headed off the big bad city to get his education.</p>
<p>When Bruce isn't debugging code, he likes to enjoy a quiet swim, fly to warm places and explore pop culture. Bruce dreams of one day being able to retire to tropical waters.</p>
